    "#Requests\n",
    "The Spotify Web API is based on REST principles. Data resources are accessed via standard HTTPS requests in UTF-8 format to an API endpoint. Where possible, Web API uses appropriate HTTP verbs for each action:\n",
    "\n",
    "METHOD\tACTION\n",
    "GET\tRetrieves resources\n",
    "POST\tCreates resources\n",
    "PUT\tChanges and/or replaces resources or collections\n",
    "DELETE\tDeletes resources\n",
    "Spotify URIs and IDs\n",
    "In requests to the Web API and responses from it, you will frequently encounter the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "PARAMETER\tDESCRIPTION\tEXAMPLE\n",
    "Spotify URI\tThe resource identifier that you can enter, for example, in the Spotify Desktop client’s search box to locate an artist, album, or track. To find a Spotify URI simply right-click (on Windows) or Ctrl-Click (on a Mac) on the artist’s or album’s or track’s name.\tspotify:track:6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6\n",
    "Spotify ID\tThe base-62 identifier that you can find at the end of the Spotify URI (see above) for an artist, track, album, playlist, etc. Unlike a Spotify URI, a Spotify ID does not clearly identify the type of resource; that information is provided elsewhere in the call.\t6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6\n",
    "Spotify category ID\tThe unique string identifying the Spotify category.\tparty\n",
    "Spotify user ID\tThe unique string identifying the Spotify user that you can find at the end of the Spotify URI for the user. The ID of the current user can be obtained via the Web API endpoint.\twizzler\n",
    "Spotify URL\tAn HTML link that opens a track, album, app, playlist or other Spotify resource in a Spotify client (which client is determined by the user’s device and account settings at play.spotify.com.\thttp://open.spotify.com/track/6rqhFgbbKwnb9MLmUQDhG6\n",
    "Rate Limiting\n",
    "Rate Limiting enables Web API to share access bandwidth to its resources equally across all users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rate limiting is applied as per application based on Client ID, and regardless of the number of users who use the application simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce the amount of requests, use endpoints that fetch multiple entities in one request. For example: If you often request single tracks, albums, or artists, use endpoints such as Get Several Tracks, Get Several Albums or Get Several Artists, instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: If Web API returns status code 429, it means that you have sent too many requests. When this happens, check the Retry-After header, where you will see a number displayed. This is the number of seconds that you need to wait, before you try your request again.\n",
    "\n",
    "Responses\n",
    "Web API returns all response data as a JSON object. See the Web API Object Model for a description of all the retrievable objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Timestamps\n",
    "Timestamps are returned in ISO 8601 format as Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) with a zero offset: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ. If the time is imprecise (for example, the date/time of an album release), an additional field indicates the precision; see for example, release_date in an album object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pagination\n",
    "Some endpoints support a way of paging the dataset, taking an offset and limit as query parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ curl\n",
    "https://api.spotify.com/v1/artists/1vCWHaC5f2uS3yhpwWbIA6/albums?album_type=SINGLE&offset=20&limit=10\n",
    "In this example, in a list of 50 (total) singles by the specified artist : From the twentieth (offset) single, retrieve the next 10 (limit) singles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The offset numbering is zero-based. Omitting the offset parameter returns the first X elements. Check the documentation for the specific endpoint and verify the default limit value. Requests that return an array of items are automatically paginated if the number of items vary. For example, tracks in a playlist. In such case, the results are returned within a paging object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional Requests\n",
    "Most API responses contain appropriate cache-control headers set to assist in client-side caching:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have cached a response, do not request it again until the response has expired.\n",
    "If the response contains an ETag, set the If-None-Match request header to the ETag value.\n",
    "If the response has not changed, the Spotify service responds quickly with 304 Not Modified status, meaning that your cached version is still good and your application should use it.\n",
    "Note: To target changes to a particular historical playlist version and have those changes rolled through to the latest version, use playlist endpoints that also return a snapshot-id. For further information, see Working With Playlists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Response Status Codes\n",
    "Web API uses the following response status codes, as defined in the RFC 2616 and RFC 6585:\n",
    "\n",
    "STATUS CODE\tDESCRIPTION\n",
    "200\tOK - The request has succeeded. The client can read the result of the request in the body and the headers of the response.\n",
    "201\tCreated - The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created.\n",
    "202\tAccepted - The request has been accepted for processing, but the processing has not been completed.\n",
    "204\tNo Content - The request has succeeded but returns no message body.\n",
    "304\tNot Modified. See Conditional requests.\n",
    "400\tBad Request - The request could not be understood by the server due to malformed syntax. The message body will contain more information; see Response Schema.\n",
    "401\tUnauthorized - The request requires user authentication or, if the request included authorization credentials, authorization has been refused for those credentials.\n",
    "403\tForbidden - The server understood the request, but is refusing to fulfill it.\n",
    "404\tNot Found - The requested resource could not be found. This error can be due to a temporary or permanent condition.\n",
    "429\tToo Many Requests - Rate limiting has been applied.\n",
    "500\tInternal Server Error. You should never receive this error because our clever coders catch them all … but if you are unlucky enough to get one, please report it to us through a comment at the bottom of this page.\n",
    "502\tBad Gateway - The server was acting as a gateway or proxy and received an invalid response from the upstream server.\n",
    "503\tService Unavailable - The server is currently unable to handle the request due to a temporary condition which will be alleviated after some delay. You can choose to resend the request again.\n",
    "Response Schema\n",
    "Web API uses two different formats to describe an error:\n",
    "\n",
    "Authentication Error Object\n",
    "Regular Error Object\n",
    "Authentication Error Object\n",
    "Whenever the application makes requests related to authentication or authorization to Web API, such as retrieving an access token or refreshing an access token, the error response follows RFC 6749 on the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "KEY\tVALUE TYPE\tVALUE DESCRIPTION\n",
    "error\tstring\tA high level description of the error as specified in RFC 6749 Section 5.2.\n",
    "error_description\tstring\tA more detailed description of the error as specified in RFC 6749 Section 4.1.2.1.\n",
    "Here is an example of a failing request to refresh an access token.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ curl -H \"Authorization: Basic Yjc...cK\" -d grant_type=refresh_token -d refresh_token=AQD...f0 \"https://accounts.spotify.com/api/token\"\n",
    "\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"error\": \"invalid_client\",\n",
    "    \"error_description\": \"Invalid client secret\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "Regular Error Object\n",
    "Apart from the response code, unsuccessful responses return a JSON object containing the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "KEY\tVALUE TYPE\tVALUE DESCRIPTION\n",
    "status\tinteger\tThe HTTP status code that is also returned in the response header. For further information, see Response Status Codes.\n",
    "message\tstring\tA short description of the cause of the error.\n",
    "Here, for example is the error that occurs when trying to fetch information for a non-existent track:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ curl -i \"https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/2KrxsD86ARO5beq7Q0Drfqa\"\n",

    "        \"message\": \"invalid id\"\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Authentication\n",
    "All requests to Web API require authentication. This is achieved by sending a valid OAuth access token in the request header. For more information about these authentication methods, see the Web API Authorization Guide."

    "KEY\tTYPE\n",
    "acousticness\n",
    "A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.\tFloat\n",
    "analysis_url\n",
    "An HTTP URL to access the full audio analysis of this track. An access token is required to access this data.\tString\n",
    "danceability\n",
    "Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.\tFloat\n",
    "duration_ms\n",
    "The duration of the track in milliseconds.\tInteger\n",
    "energy\n",
    "Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.\tFloat\n",
    "id\n",
    "The Spotify ID for the track.\tString\n",
    "instrumentalness\n",
    "Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0.\tFloat\n",
    "key\n",
    "The key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation . E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on.\tInteger\n",
    "liveness\n",
    "Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live.\tFloat\n",
    "loudness\n",
    "The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db.\tFloat\n",
    "mode\n",
    "Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.\tInteger\n",
    "speechiness\n",
    "Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.\tFloat\n",
    "tempo\n",
    "The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.\tFloat\n",
    "time_signature\n",
    "An estimated overall time signature of a track. The time signature (meter) is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure).\tInteger\n",
    "track_href\n",
    "A link to the Web API endpoint providing full details of the track.\tString\n",
    "type\n",
    "The object type: “audio_features”\tString\n",
    "uri\n",
    "The Spotify URI for the track.\tString\n",
    "valence\n",
    "A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry)."
